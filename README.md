# Face-Mask-Detection-| Machine learning |
Face Mask Detection Using Python, Keras, OpenCV and Tensorflow.
Detect Masks in Real-time Video.
The Accuracy is approx 99%.
With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV or other types cameras to detect and identify people without masks. 
With the prevailing worldwide situation due to COVID-19 pandemic, these types of systems would be very supportive for many kind of institutions around the world.
